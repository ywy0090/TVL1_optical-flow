# TVL1_optical-flow
The optical flow demonstration program, the algorithm code comes from the paper, Javier Sánchez Pérez, Enric Meinhardt-Llopis, and Gabriele Facciolo, TV-L1 Optical Flow Estimation, Image Processing On Line, 3 (2013), pp. 137–150. http://dx.doi.org/10.5201/ipol.2013.26. 
In order to run the program, you need the Open CV library. A video file is required.
The program reads a video file and demonstrates the optical flow in a window.
